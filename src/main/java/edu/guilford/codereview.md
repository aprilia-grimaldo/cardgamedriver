# Code review notes:

## 1. Utility classes

All of the following code executes correctly what is intended in the original code:

- `Card` class
- `Deck` class
- `Hand` class (and correctly gets total value for Blackjack)

The `Blackjack` class also correctly executes what is described in the README file.
